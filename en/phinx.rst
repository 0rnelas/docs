Phinx Documentation
===================

Phinx is a standalone command line tool for managing database Migrations. The official Migrations plugin for CakePHP is based on this tool.

Phinx makes it ridiculously easy to manage the database migrations for your PHP app. In less than 5 minutes, you can install Phinx using Composer and create your first database migration. Phinx is just about migrations without all the bloat of a database ORM system or application framework.
